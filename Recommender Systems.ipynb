Of these matches there are 345 unique users who receive a match. So there is only a small group of users who receive more than one match. And a small number of matches on the total of 76392 likes and dislikes.\n",

    "The Data is therefore very sparse. Of these 76392 likes and dislikes there are only 12637 likes. This is 16,5% likes. Of these likes there are only 415 matches. Thus only 3,3% mutual likes. This is sparse data to work with. You see in the visualization that there is some correlation between the number of received likes and the number of given likes. You see in the visualization above that the more likes a person received correlates with the less likes a user gives. Since that user gets a lot of likes the user gets critical for liking another user. Thus it also holds for when a user doesn't receive many likes than that user has is less critical of other users and gives more likes.\n",
